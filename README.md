## Project Information:

We are creating our own web chat server using a java web application project.
Our chat server will use websocksets and HTML/JS/CSS. Our web chat server
has multiple chat room, messages can only be sent to those on the same room.
Upon joining a different room, users will automatically leave their previous
room. A user needs to in a room in order to be able to send chat messages.

## Improvements:

The improvements that we made to the interface is that we displayed the unique code that was generated to help users 
see which room they were in. We also changed the way the buttons looked to help with visibility. Everything else 
was just changes to the appearance of the website, for example we changed the background to a grey and white, with white color text, and for the about
page we changed the background to all grey with orange color text. We kept the chat
rooms and everything the same position but we made the chat room text boxed, so it would
look cleaner.

## How to run:
To get git clone on windows open git bash if not already installed. Then on git bash input $ cd
and the folder location. Then get the git clone link, and do $ git clone and then the link. For mac
you would open up terminal type cd and the location to the folder. Then do git clone and paste the copy
of the link. When the user first accesses the web page, the user would first need to create a new chat room.
After the user will be asked to be asked to enter a username, and then a message would pop up
to greet the new user. The user can now send messages and to send the messages the user would need
to press the enter key button. To get to our about page you would click the about button on the top
of the page, where it would list information about the web application, and the contributors.

## Other resources:
We used lecture notes, such as WSChatServerDemo that was used for reference.
